 * First and foremost, these implementations need to be optimized.  As I am sure is obvious, the author was a relative novice in Haskell when this project was first developed.  Some parts have been optimized (using -prof with ghc), but much work remains.

 * It would be relatively easy to parallelize parts of these search algorithms.
